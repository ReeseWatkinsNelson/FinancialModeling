# Financial Modeling

The course Financial Data and Analysis  (FIN 357) teaches students how to use Excel to build various types of financial models for financial analysis. These models strengthen the ability to Budget, Forecast, and perform other vital financial functions. 

I am taking this class because it will help strengthen my knowledge of excel, ability to conduct financial analysis, and exposure to how core financial functions are optimized through modern information systems, such as spreadsheet software. 

The material you will find in this repository consists of case studies and chapter problems, these problems are from the textbook _Financial Analysis with Microsoft Excel (2019)_by Timothy Mayes. Feel free to peek around and see some examples of my coursework.
