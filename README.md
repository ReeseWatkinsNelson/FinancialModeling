# Financial Modeling

The course Financial Data and Analysis  (FIN 357) teaches students to use Excel to build various types of spreadsheet 
models for financial analysis. These models strengthen the ability to Budget, Forecast, analyze Cash Flow, and perform 
vital functions sustaining a company's ability to operate.

The material you will find in this repository consists of case studies and chapter problems, these problems are from the 
textbook __Financial Analysis with Microsoft Excel (2019)__ by Timothy Mayes. Feel free to peek around and see some examples 
of my coursework.
